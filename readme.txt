2. Download and activate the Advanced Custom Fields Limiter Plugin.
3. Create some fields and apply them to a editing area.
4. Go to the 'Custom Fields > Limiters' menu and set a limit for each field.

__Usage__

This plugin won't do anything if 'Advanced Custom Fields' is not activated.

Go to the 'Custom Fields > Limiters' menu and set a limit for each field of Advanced Custom Fields. These limits will be applied in every admin interface with a small counter within the text input area of the field.

By now, the plugin performs only a JavaScript check, and won't run any PHP to limit these fields.
